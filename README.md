Library for manipulation of simplicial complexes
and cochains defined over them.

The focus of this package is on the formalism of
**Discrete Exterior Calculus**
and its applications to statistical rankings
and extraction of topological features from simplicial triangulations.

## Installation
To install this package, all you have to do is to enter `]` on the Julia REPL and write
```julia
pkg> add Hodge
```

## Basic Usage
To use this package,
one starts defining a simplicial complex
```julia
using Hodge
K = SimplicialComplex([(1,2,3), (1,2,4), [1], [1,5,9,6], (2,6)])
```

Then it is possible to retrieve topological information from the complex
```julia
euler_characteristic(K)
betti(K)
```

Or one can define Cochains over `K`,
which are skew-symmetric tensors over the simplices of `K`,
and work with them
```julia
f = Cochain{Float64, 2}(K)
f[1,2,3] = 3.0
f[1,2,4] = -5.9
f[4,3,2] = 13.2
f[1,4,3] = Ï€

g = coboundary(f)
w = coboundary_adj(f)
h = laplacian(f)
c = cup(f, h)

a, b, c = hodge(f)
```
